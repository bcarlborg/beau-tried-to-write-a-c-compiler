# TODOS
_a very light weigt list of the next steps_

## Minor Todos
- [] add a `verbose` option to the compiler driver that specifies which programs it is calling
  - when passed we should echo when each stage of the compiler is being called and how it is being
    called (i.e. what command is being invoked and with which arguments)
- setup the `./compiler` node script to create the new file that it is going to output

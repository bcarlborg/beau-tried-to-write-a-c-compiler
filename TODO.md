# TODOS
_a very light weigt list of the next steps_

## Minor Todos
- [ ] continue on to assembly generation
- [ ] make the indent helper a generic helper
- [ ] make function body its own ast node in c. It should be
      an array of statements;
- [ ] convert project to typescript
- [ ] make a test suite


## Notes for re-write
- do not include debugging functions in the tree data structures
  instead, separate the data and the functionality
- move each phase into its own file
